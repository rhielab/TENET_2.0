TENET (Tracing Enhancer Networks using Epigenetic Traits)
THIS INCLUDES MODIFICATIONS FOR ANALYZING NEW TCGA DATA FOR LUAD (updates to hg38 genome too!)

## Packages:
The new ELMER versions (2.X.Y) don't seem to work with how TENET is currently written.
Here I have downloaded older versions of ELMER and ELMER.data
I am currently using ELMER 1.5.1 and ELMER.data 0.99.6
install ELMER 1.5.1 from bioaRchive
install ELMER.data 0.99.6 from github (https://github.com/lijingya/ELMER.data)

## Data:

# Methylation data:
This is TCGA LUAD methylation Beta-values downloaded using TCGAbiolinks 2.6.10 (downloaded from their Github page)
485,577 probes are available on the Infinium HumanMethylation450K array in total, but TCGA only has Beta-values for
396,065 probes (remaining probes are listed as NA)

# Expression data:
This is TCGA LUAD expression FPKM-UQ (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads - upper quartile normalized) 
downloaded using TCGAbiolinks 2.6.10 (downloaded from their Github page). This dataset includes 60,483 genes with ensembl annotations
as annotated by Gencode v22. These are mapped to the hg38 construction of the genome.

# Enhancer data:
These are H3K27ac narrowpeaks called using the ENCODE3 pipeline v1 (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lG_Rd7fnYgRpSIqrIfuVlAz2dW1VaSQThzk836Db99c/edit#heading=h.9ecc41kilcvq)
The final dataset here contains 81,479 peaks mapped to the hg38 genome and created using the reduce() function from the Granges package on 5 overlapped datasets:

Dataset 1: IDR-passed peaks from two A549 reps from ENCODE (https://www.encodeproject.org/biosamples/ENCBS161AAA/)

Dataset 2: Any overlapping peaks [created with findOverlapsofPeaks() from ChIPpeakAnno] called in Day0 primary alveolar epithelial cells from the IAO lab collected from two subjects:
3/2013 lung from a 62-YO male, and 2/2014 lung from a 25-YO male (possible smoker). 

Dataset 3: Any overlapping peaks [created with findOverlapsofPeaks() from ChIPpeakAnno] called in Day4 primary alveolar epithelial cells from the IAO lab collected from two subjects:
3/2013 lung from a 62-YO male, and 2/2014 lung from a 25-YO male (possible smoker). 

Dataset 4: Any overlapping peaks [created with findOverlapsofPeaks() from ChIPpeakAnno] called in Day6 primary alveolar epithelial cells from the IAO lab collected from two subjects:
3/2013 lung from a 62-YO male, and 2/2014 lung from a 25-YO male (possible smoker). 

Dataset 5: Any overlapping peaks [created with findOverlapsofPeaks() from ChIPpeakAnno] between at least 2 of 3 total raw lung tissue samples;
one from a 53-YO female from ENCODE (https://www.encodeproject.org/biosamples/ENCBS684YJH/),
one from a 30-YO female from ROADMAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM906395),
and one from a 3-YO male from ROADMAP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM1013123)

# Nucleosome depleted regions:

25,000 (truncated from 262,665) ATAC-seq peaks from (WHICH LUNG), mapped to the hg38 genome

117,759 DNAseI HS peaks in A549 cells downloaded from ENCODE () and mapped to the hg38 genome [see below]. 
Peaks were originally mapped to hg19 genome, and I lifted them over to hg38 using hgLiftOver (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver)

## Reference Files:

# hm450cg_GEO.GR.bed:
This is an overwrite of the previous hm450cg_GEO.GR.bed file, this time with annotations for the probes in the hg38 genome.
Annotations were provided from http://zwdzwd.github.io/InfiniumAnnotation with more details provided in the paper:
Zhou W, Laird PW and Shen H, Comprehensive characterization, annotation and innovative use of Infinium DNA Methylation BeadChip probes, Nucleic Acids Research 2017
File is in bed format, with untitled columns=	chromosome	start	end	probe_name[(cg########)]	dummy_collumn[all '0']	strand
Note: 6 probes are annotated to mitochondrial genome, and 30 probes do not properly map to the genome. According to the authors this was done on the basis of a BLAST 
for the methylation probes, rather than a simple liftover!
