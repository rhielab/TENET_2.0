This is the data to store information about relevant enhancer regions for the TENET study of interest. Data should be input in the form of tab-delimited .bed files (see ENCODE guidelines), but should absolutely include information regarding peak chromosome, start, and end files. For maximal accuracy, remember .bed files should be 0-indexed.
