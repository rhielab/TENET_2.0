This is the folder to hold clinical data as an individual file. Data will need to be loaded in the form of a 
.txt file and will have to include columns of data named "bcr_patient_barcode", "days_to_death", "days_to_last_followup", and “vital_status”. This is best accomplished using tcgabiolinks to download and compile the TCGA clinical data.
